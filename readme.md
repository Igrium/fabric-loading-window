# Minecraft Loading Window

One thing I find really annoying is that the Minecraft splash screen doesn't open for a while after the game is launched, making it hard to determine what's going on without the console open. This dead-simple mod fixes that by showing an AWT loading screen until the game finishes initializing.

**Due to a limitation imposed by the operating system, this mod does not work on Mac.**
